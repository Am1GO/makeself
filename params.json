{"name":"Makeself","body":"makeself.sh is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable tar.gz archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is. The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an optional arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation script). This is pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world. Makeself archives also include checksums for integrity self-validation (CRC and/or MD5 checksums).\r\n\r\nThe makeself.sh script itself is used only to create the archives from a directory of files. The resultant archive is actually a compressed (using gzip, bzip2, or compress) TAR archive, with a small shell script stub at the beginning. This small stub performs all the steps of extracting the files, running the embedded command, and removing the temporary files when it's all over. All what the user has to do to install the software contained in such an archive is to \"run\" the archive, i.e sh nice-software.run. I recommend using the \"run\" (which was introduced by some Makeself archives released by Loki Software) or \"sh\" suffix for such archives not to confuse the users, since they know it's actually shell scripts (with quite a lot of binary data attached to it though!).\r\n\r\nI am trying to keep the code of this script as portable as possible, i.e it's not relying on any bash-specific features and only calls commands that are installed on any functioning UNIX-compatible system. This script as well as the archives it generates should run on any Unix flavor, with any compatible Bourne shell, provided of course that the compression programs are available.\r\n\r\nAs of version 2.1, Makeself has been rewritten and tested on the following platforms :\r\n\r\nLinux (all distributions)\r\nSun Solaris (8 and above)\r\nHP-UX (tested on 11.0 and 11i on HPPA RISC)\r\nSCO OpenUnix and OpenServer\r\nIBM AIX 5.1L\r\nMacOS X (Darwin)\r\nSGI IRIX 6.5\r\nFreeBSD\r\nUnicOS / Cray\r\nCygwin (Windows)\r\nIf you successfully run Makeself and/or archives created with it on another system, then let me know!\r\n\r\nExamples of publicly available archives made using makeself are :\r\n\r\nGame patches and installers for Id Software games like Quake 3 for Linux or Return To Castle Wolfenstien ;\r\nAll game patches released by Loki Software for the Linux version of popular games ;\r\nThe nVidia drivers for Linux\r\nThe installer for the Linux version of Google Earth\r\nThe VirtualBox installers for Linux\r\nThe Makeself distribution itself ;-)\r\nand countless others...\r\nImportant note for Apache users: By default, most Web servers will think that Makeself archives are regular text files and thus they may show up as text in a Web browser. The correct way to prevent this is to add a MIME type for this file format, like so (in httpd.conf) :\r\n\r\nAddType application/x-makeself .run\r\n\r\nImportant note for recent GNU/Linux distributions: Archives created with Makeself prior to v2.1.2 were using an old syntax for the head and tail Unix commands that is being progressively obsoleted in their GNU forms. Therefore you may have problems uncompressing some of these archives. A workaround for this is to set the environment variable $_POSIX2_VERSION to enable the old syntax, i.e. :\r\n\r\nexport _POSIX2_VERSION=199209\r\n","tagline":"A self-extracting archiving tool for Unix systems, in 100% shell script.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
